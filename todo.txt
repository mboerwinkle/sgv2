fighter ai (passes instead of circling)

smooth view shifting
asteroid field
stamina/boost
have distance function check for overflow
show which functions take up the most cpu time on server

ai multithreading (1)
Polygon checking multithreading (3)
bullet collision multithreading (2)


ways to speed up ship collisions:
	split up models into octants/bsp/bounding boxes
