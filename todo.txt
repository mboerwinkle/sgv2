go through and check that my casted math is done right
bounding boxes for bullets/ship collisions
store the actual meshes in non-compacted data structures for speed.

send hp in network data

fighter ai (passes instead of circling)
spawn request queue

smooth view shifting
names
team struct
destroyer ai
asteroid field
stamina/boost
have distance function check for overflow
show which functions take up the most cpu time on server

ai multithreading (1)
Polygon checking multithreading (3)
bullet collision multithreading (2)


ways to speed up ship collisions:


	precalculate edges (speed boost x2)
		--PLEASE REENABLE BOUNDING SPHERES

	macro for revQuatMult
